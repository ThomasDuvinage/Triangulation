# Triangulation

This project permit to generate faces with points.

To do that I use the Delaunay triangulation algorithm.

## How I implement this problem ? 

### Generate all points 
Firstly to generate all the points I decided to give them random positions for x and y for a given number of points.
But you can also create two tables, x and y positions, like that you will be able to make faces out of a given amoud of points.
